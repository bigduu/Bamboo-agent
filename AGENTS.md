# Bamboo Agent Guidance

Read [README.md](./README.md) for the product boundary. Use this canonical Jiandu memory contract:

- Session memory is continuity for the current session. Project memory holds durable project facts and decisions; Global memory holds cross-project user context.
- Recall with a short lexical query. Use Jiandu's compact default top three `id`/summary results, then `get` only the selected item that needs full context.
- Query before writing. Store one confirmed atomic fact with a specific title and a few useful keywords, entities, and tags.
- Treat canonical Project memory as trusted durable project authority, but verify live repository or runtime state before acting. Treat Dream as a low-trust derived orientation snapshot, never as canonical evidence.
- Never store secrets or tokens. Do not add embeddings, vectors, or a duplicate Bamboo persistence/index layer.

Jiandu owns canonical persistence, derived indexes, lexical recall, and Dream snapshot bytes. Bamboo owns prompt selection and budget, optional reranking, and the model and cadence used to refresh Dream.
